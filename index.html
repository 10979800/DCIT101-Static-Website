                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p1>The Rottweiler a robust working breed of great strenght descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and lighter. The glistening, short black coat with smart rust marking add to the picture of imposing strenght. A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive.</p1>
                    <p2>It is believed that the Rottweiler was developed by Romans in Germany around 74AD. Rotties were use to drive cattle by day and to guard the herd by night. They were bred to be large and stong and to help control and navigate large bulls. When herding cattle was made illegal, Rotties became nearly extinct!. They became popular again later when used as draught dogs by butchers. In the early 1900's, a breed club was formed to perserve the breed. With proper socialization, Rottweiler make strong and loyal companions. The Rottweiler is a generally healthy breed with an average lifespan of 12 years.</p2>
